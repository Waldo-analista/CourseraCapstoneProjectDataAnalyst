# CourseraCapstoneProjectDataAnalyst
This is my project to pass the last course to obtain the professional data analyst certificate given by Coursera.
The project is to analyze a data file of a survey (Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019) made on the website Stack Overflow about the technologies that programmers use the most and the trends on the use of technologies for the following year (2020). I use the data visualization tool called IBM Cognos Analytics, creating data files using web scraping from python libraries and API REST.
